improvements:
- colors in jenkins console
- details with list of validations in addldetails. - in build_audit
- get all configuration details by api call .. apart from build service url. - This is for shell scripts.
- validation on request API's - before proceeding to process.
- add index for tables.

validation:
- stop building if previous module version jars is not deployed. against with different DT but not with same DT/case, by category of same module -{This is becuase module dependencies is missing if we allow}
- first level module jars should not use in same level other module.  {it should go to common}
- validation time. logging into db.. that is: impacted modules because of dependency changed. against each dependency against module list. - audit in addldetails column in build-audit.
- Complex: constraint on consolidation time - filter module by previous DT. Stop previous DT not deployed. Inform them to select previous DT also for consolidation. 
- common DT should be ignored.

bugs:
=======
preBuildProcess() 
    
    - pull 
    - dryrun on merge?
    - validation
    - generate build command.
    - update impacted modules if any. {product release details in build audit}. , 
    
    return.

build - 
updateBuildStatus API.

postBuildProcess()
   - impacted modules to build. create a report if any compilation issues. stop.
   - generateArtifacts
   - upload
   - audit
  
 
 steps in jenkins:
  
 1. buildProcess.sh
 
    - rest call preBuildProcess() API.
            - pull the changes from origin master. - sync
            - preBuildValidate java method
            
    - rest call getBuildCommand() API.
    
    - trigger sonar analysis - shell method
    
    - rest call postBuildProcess() API
            - generateArtifacts - java method
             { - tx mode
            - uploadArtifacts - java method
            - audit to db.  - java method
             }
             
    - postBuildAction in jenkin
    - Trigger build notification email.
